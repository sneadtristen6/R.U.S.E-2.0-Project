"""Locate bundled engine data files whether running from source or a PyInstaller exe.

Data under ``ruse_mod_engine/data/`` (the build-id registry, cross-version migration maps, the DSL
and placement catalogs) is collected INTO the exe at ``<_MEIPASS>/ruse_mod_engine/data/``.
``__file__``-relative paths are unreliable when frozen (onefile), so — exactly like ``i18n.data_dir``
does for ``lang/`` — prefer ``sys._MEIPASS`` when frozen and fall back to the source tree.

"""Where units can go: the navigation graphs in a map's `mapinfo.win` (DataMap_Win.dat, `datasmap\\<map>\\
mapinfo.win`, buffers 1 and 2; read with `ruse_mod_engine.sdb.split_mapinfo`).

A graph is a set of overlapping circles of ground units can use, linked where two meet: units plan from circle to
circle through the meeting points. Circle centres sit on a 320-unit grid and radii are multiples of 320 (1280 to
81920 on Blitz), the largest first. Checked on Blitz (2026-09-30):

- **Two levels.** The main graph covers the play area coarsely: water (the river, lakes) and the land outside the
  play area are what no circle covers; towns are inside it (80% of building spots). Its local graphs (22 on Blitz,
  none sharing a circle with it) each cover one town-sized patch (1 km or 200 m) finely, and their circles keep
  off the buildings: 3% of the building spots in their areas are inside them, against 52% of random spots and 64%
  of trees. So buildings are obstacles only where a local graph is; a building placed in open ground is not.
- **Buffer 1 is for infantry, buffer 2 for vehicles:** buffer 1 covers 79% of the woods' cells, buffer 2 14%
  (open ground: 85% and 83%). Vehicles can't enter woods.

    header       84 bytes: f32 x0, y0 (0, 0) and size (the map's side), then u16 circles, links, crossings, and
                 sub-graphs; the rest zeros
    offsets      u32 per section, from the graph's start: circles, links, lists, crossings, points, then one per
                 sub-graph
    circles      (circles + 1) × 16 bytes: f32 x, y, radius; u16 where its list starts (in the list section); u16
                 where its crossings start. The last record is (0, 0, 0, the lists' total, the crossings' total)
    links        links × 12 bytes: u16 circle a < circle b, f32 x, y (a point where they meet); sorted by b
    lists        u16 link numbers: each circle's links, the circles one after another (every link twice)
    crossings    crossings × 28 bytes: a trip through a circle, from one link's meeting point to another's: two
                 points (f32 x, y each), its length, the two link numbers, a word; route costs
    points       a spatial index of the circles, up to the first sub-graph: branch records (u16 1, u16 how far
                 to skip, f32 x, y: a split point) and leaf records (u16 count, then that many circle numbers);
                 not written by us yet
    sub-graphs   the same layout again, without sub-graphs of their own (22 on Blitz)
